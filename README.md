A little simulator games for growing trees 

The Patterns:
Singleton - used in GameManager and GameObject
used the singletons to make a single instance of the GameManager and the tree itself that i could access from anywhere

Observer - used in GameManager and TreeController
used to Grow the Trees B) 

ObjectPool - used in TreePool
used to spawn several trees at the same time
